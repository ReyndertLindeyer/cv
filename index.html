        <p>I am a programmer who has been learning one language or another for the past five years, I started with Java but am now code mostly in C# and C++. Over my education at Humber College I have created several small games as well as various
          C++ math
          libraries in my math classes.</p>

        <p>Over my time at Humber I've also learned how to use both Unity and Unreal with my Capstone having been coded in Unreal using almost exclusively C++.</p>

        <p>Below are my two Github repositories, the Eugenides repository is an older one of mine that has a few small school projects on it as well as the Game Jam game that myself and a few friends tried to make this past January. The
          ReyndertLindeyer
          repository was made for my capstone as I wanted an official student account for the project.</p>
